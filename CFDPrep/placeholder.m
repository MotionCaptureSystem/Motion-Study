function placeholder()
%%This function does nothing except force GITHUB to include the directory
%%that it is placed in.  This is required because i have local files that
%%are ignored, so I need the folder, but when the code is downloaded the
%%user gets a warning because the dir doesn't exist.  This file can be
%%deleted after a committed file is added to this folder.
